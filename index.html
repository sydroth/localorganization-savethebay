        Save The Bay is the largest regional organization working to protect, restore and celebrate San Francisco Bay since 1961. We engage more than 50,000 supporters, advocates, and volunteers to protect the Bay and make it cleaner and healthier for people and wildlife.

        Save The Bay is leading a region-wide effort to re-establish 100,000 acres of tidal marsh that are essential for a healthy Bay. Volunteers from the community, local businesses, and schools work with our science team to perform hands-on restoration of the Bay shoreline. Save The Bay inspires the next generation of Bay activists through our award-winning restoration education programs.
