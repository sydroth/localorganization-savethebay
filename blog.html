          <p>With nearly all of the votes counted, it appears that voters throughout the Bay Area last night approved Measure AA, a first of its kind regional ballot initiative that will generate $500 million for restoration of San Francisco Bay wetlands. With 965,543 votes counted so far, the measure is passing with 69.08% of the vote and the campaign is confident in its projected victory.
          </p>

          <p>"All indications show that the voters overwhelmingly agreed that restoring the Bay Area's most precious natural resource is a top priority," said Save the Bay's Executive Director David Lewis. "Tonight's vote is a resounding victory for wildlife and people who want a healthy, beautiful Bay for future generations."</p>

        <h3>A Restoration Journey</h3>

          <p>On a foggy early morning in 2012, I stepped out of our big red Save The Bay truck into my first restoration site in East Palo Alto. Little did I know I was merely taking the first step on my long, rewarding journey with Save The Bay. As we set out tools, gloves and maps of the Bay, I eagerly assisted the experienced field staff in preparation to lead a large group of volunteers. But when it came to addressing the group for our introduction, I became timid of talking in front of such a large audience.
          </p>

          <p>As I led more programs, my fear of public speaking diminished and as I talked to volunteers I increasingly grew so proud of Save The Bay's grassroots beginning and the victories won to prevent irreversible damage to such a unique, but once undervalued ecosystem. The history and future of the San Francisco Bay is such an interesting and ever-changing story, and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to share this with our volunteers.</p>
